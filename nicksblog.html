        <p>Today I didn't learn too too much as it is<br> 
        the first day back from March break.<br> 
        So naturally everyone including myself <br> 
        is just getting back into the swing of things.<br> 
        Although i look forward to continue learning and<br>  
        experimenting with processing as it <br>
        is a whole lot of fun.</p>

        <p class="header">03/20/2018</p>
        
        <p>Today i learned how to make funky looking pictures<br>  
            using simply ellipses and creating a<br> 
            spectrum of color using rgb (mouseX,mouseY,mouseX).</p>

        <p>Today i learned whether or not i just so happen to have epilepsy,<br>  
            given the fact that im writing this,<br> 
           you can infer that I do not have epilepsy.<br> 
           Real talk, I learned how to randomize color using the rgb model<br>
           and make a shape move across the screen and get bigger or smaller.</p>
