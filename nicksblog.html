        <h4>1.  Jaffar Shaikh: Software Engineer</h4>

        <h5>Software Engineer:</h5><br> 
    <p>The main job of a software engineer is to program and create the digital environment 
    where computers and other technologies can function. This can involve programming operating systems, 
    applications and other networking aspects that involve coding in different languages. In order to become 
    a software engineer the main requirement is a degree in software, math or science, and the ability to program 
    in multiple languages. Since this industry is also growing very quickly, it also requires a lot of learning on 
    the job, meaning that a software engineer needs to make sure that he or she is constantly updating their knowledge 
    on computer languages staying current with new technologies in the industry.</p> 

<h5>Responses:</h5><br>
<p>Computer Science trains me with tools and technologies to solve problems at hand. The group I work with is involved in 
Cloud Networking and I use several cloud computing technologies to build features in portal that configures the cloud network.
Everyday we design and build software features, find problems in the product and solve them. To build a product first we gather 
requirements from customers then design features, build them and thoroughly test them and finally release a product to the customer. 
Each and every step is important in building a reliable product. Computer Science is a dynamic field which continuously improves and 
expects the practitioner to be a continuous learner. Majority of new technologies are now Open Sourced, available on internet for 
everyone to use for free. All the new technologies are getting Cloud based and offered as service on the internet, this helps software 
designers to use the services than build them on their own. Every single field is affected by software technology and that is making 
each job associated with the field depend on skilled workers in that software technology. Every future job will most certainly be
based on skilled workers who use latest software and technology. This is the reason why everybody should learn Computer Science to 
be a skilled worker. </p>
        
        <h4>2.  Ann Nemec: Statistician at Stats Canada</h4>

        <h5>Statician:</h5><br> 
    <p>A Statisticians job is to interpret, work and analyze with statistics, both theoretical and actual. The roles of 
        statistician can vary depending on where the job is being done but overall the role of the job is very much the 
        same no matter where you work. Most statistician nowadays use computer software to do their work, whether that be 
        together and interpret the data, or simply to organize and display it. Most statistician jobs require a high degree 
        in mathematics from a university, and a degree in statistic (or a related field). Statistics and data is becoming of 
        more and more importance, because it really gives us a picture of what the world is like in the form of numbers.</p> 

<h5>Responses:</h5><br>
<p>Computer science and computers as a whole are extremely crucial to not only my position but just about every position as StatsCan, 
like we have all the different sorting algorithms used to manae the multitude of databases we have to maintain. Ever since I got 
promoted its been a lot more on my feet going to meetings managing the people in my division etc... but prior, a regular day would 
consist of emailing back and forth with collegues, writing reports on different datasets and preparing presentations to propose 
different approaches to efficient workflow. The most important aspect of computer science to my job hands down has to be the programs 
that make managing and handling loads of data all at once so incredibly easy, and me of all people would know, ive been working here 
before we had all the new and fancy tech. I would personally say my work and computer science go hand in hand, and the different 
aspects are used very very frequently on a daily basis. Had the byproducts of computer science not come as far as they have or just 
simply not exist to begin with today, our jobs would be a heck of a lot harder and way more manual in terms of data management and 
organisation. With how computer science is moving as a field so many things are being put out of use simply due to the increase in 
practicality, for example the increasingly dimishing demand for factory workers due to most of the work becoming autonomous and so on.
Just to put it simply its important to learn and familiarize yourself with computer science atleast because it is the future. Plain and simple</p>
