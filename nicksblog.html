        <h4>1.  Jaffar Shaikh: Software Engineer</h4>

        <h5>Software Engineer:</h5><br> 
    <h5>The main job of a software engineer is to program and create the digital environment 
    where computers and other technologies can function. This can involve programming operating systems, 
    applications and other networking aspects that involve coding in different languages. In order to become 
    a software engineer the main requirement is a degree in software, math or science, and the ability to program 
    in multiple languages. Since this industry is also growing very quickly, it also requires a lot of learning on 
    the job, meaning that a software engineer needs to make sure that he or she is constantly updating their knowledge 
    on computer languages staying current with new technologies in the industry.</h5> 

<h5>Responses:</h5><br>
<p>Computer Science trains me with tools and technologies to solve problems at hand. The group I work with is involved in Cloud Networking and I use several cloud computing technologies to build features in portal that configures the cloud network.
Everyday we design and build software features, find problems in the product and solve them. To build a product first we gather requirements from customers then design features, build them and thoroughly test them and finally release a product to the customer. Each and every step is important in building a reliable product. Computer Science is a dynamic field which continuously improves and expects the practitioner to be a continuous learner. Majority of new technologies are now Open Sourced, available on internet for everyone to use for free. All the new technologies are getting Cloud based and offered as service on the internet, this helps software designers to use the services than build them on their own.
Every single field is affected by software technology and that is making each job associated with the field depend on skilled workers in that software technology. Every future job will most certainly be based on skilled workers who use latest software and technology. This is the reason why everybody should learn Computer Science to be a skilled worker.
